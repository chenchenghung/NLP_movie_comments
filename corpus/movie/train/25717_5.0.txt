“Freddie Mercury was absolutely charismatic. Brian May was just this brilliant guitarist. Roger Talyor was a phenomenal drummer. And then you had that guy who played bass.”哈哈哈哈哈！乐队在六个不同的studio录了Bohemian Raphsody. Freddie花了十分钟在酒吧写了Crazy Little Thing. Deacon想出了Under Pressure的riff，然而出去吃了个披萨回来就忘了，还好Roger记得旋律，响指是David的主意。They are all LEGENGS！
