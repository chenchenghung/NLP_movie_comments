The best drivers focus only on the present. Never dwelling on the past, never committing to the future. “What if I don't win?” “There's no dishonor in losing the race, there's only dishonor in not racing because you are afraid to lose.” If a driver has the courage to create his own conditions, then the rain is simply rain.
