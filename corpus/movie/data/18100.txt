三觀極其正確的暴躁小老頭，我覺得這輯甚至要比《You're all diseased》要好看許多！由abortion引申出來的sanctity of life正好是我一直在想的，George的發聲更加震動人：dead people give less than a shit about the sanctity of life, only living people care about it. so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view. It's a self-serving, man-made bullshit story.僞善者有許多面目，George選擇撕碎！
