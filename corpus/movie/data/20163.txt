Terayama's final film reworks Marquez into a haunting treatise on Japan's embrace of modernity, ending with photographyâ€”and thereby Terayama himself. Terayama manages to form a wondrous little universe within the constraints (cf clocks and chastity belts) of a two-hour literary adaptation, and his experimental use of color is bold and breathtaking.
